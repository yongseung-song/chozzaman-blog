# Chozzaman's blog

This is a repo for a blog that I made(hopefully) with Nextjs and Contentful. The backstory is as typical as it can be - as a fresh junior frontend developer, why not build my own website that I can show my portfolio and blog posts at once? - but thinking is one thing and doing it is another. It's been lingering in my head for like months and now I'm on it,

## To-do

- [ ] examine overall structure of the project
- [ ] learn how to use Contentful's CDA(Content Delivery API)
- [ ] design the page
